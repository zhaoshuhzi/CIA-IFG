# CIA Framework: Causal Inference Analysis for Brain Networks

This repo implements a full pipeline of the CIA framework as described in recent neuroimaging studies, using MNE, Bayesian networks, SEM, and counterfactual verification.

## Features
- EEG ERP source localization via MNE
- Functional network DAG construction via NOTEARS
- SEM-based validation
- Counterfactual causality check with TiMINo and Granger causality

## Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cia_pipeline.py
